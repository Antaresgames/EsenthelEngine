The 3 files in the project need to have .cc extension changed to .cpp because Emscripten fails to compile.

Snapy.cpp (this will improve compression significantly)
        uint32 bytes_between_hash_lookups = skip >> 5;
        skip += bytes_between_hash_lookups;
replace with:
        uint32 bytes_between_hash_lookups = skip++ >> 5;

"snappy-stubs-public.h" did not exist in the main branch, but was included in a public release, so it was copied from there.

comment out all:
	#include <string>
	#include <vector>
	typedef std::string string;
but keep:
	#include <string.h>

comment out all functions that use 'string'
