The file was generated by using following command when executing from a sample project location
D:\Progs\AndroidSDK\tools\android update lib-project --path . --target X
where X can be obtained from:
D:\Progs\AndroidSDK\tools\android list targets

Then the file was modified, to disable PAK file compression inside APK(ZIP) archives, this had to be done by copying parts of:
	D:\Progs\AndroidSDK\tools\ant\build.xml
The copied part is:
	<target name="-package-resources">
		..
	</target>

and adding in it:
	<nocompress extension="pak"/>
